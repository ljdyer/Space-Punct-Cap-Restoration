| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Feature Restorer Metric Getter](https://github.com/ljdyer/Feature-Restorer-Metric-Getter)  | A Python class for calculating precision/recall/F-score and word error rate (WER) metrics for the outputs of feature restoration models against reference strings.  |

### Models

| Repo name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Naive Bayes Space Restorer](https://github.com/ljdyer/Naive-Bayes-Space-Restorer) | A Python class to allow enable convenient training of a Naive Bayes-based statistical model for restoration of spaces to unsegmented streams of input characters.
| [BiLSTM Char Feature Restorer](https://github.com/ljdyer/BiLSTM-Char-Feature-Restorer/)  | A Python class to allow enable convenient training of BiLSTM character-level models for restoration of features such as spaces, punctuation, and capitalisation to unsegmented streams of input characters.  |
