## Code repositories

### Evaluation

**[Feature Restorer Evaluator](https://github.com/ljdyer/Feature-Restorer-Evaluator)** <br>
Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of ML models for restoration of textual features

### Models

**[Naive Bayes Space Restorer](https://github.com/ljdyer/Naive-Bayes-Space-Restorer)**<br>
A Python class to enable convenient training of a Naive Bayes-based statistical model for restoration of spaces to
unsegmented streams of input characters. (Referred to in the paper as **NB**.)

**[BiLSTM Char Feature Restorer](https://github.com/ljdyer/BiLSTM-Char-Feature-Restorer/)**<br>
A Python class to enable convenient training of BiLSTM character-level models for restoration of features such as
spaces, punctuation, and capitalisation to unsegmented streams of input characters. (Referred to in the paper as
**BiLSTMCharSpace**/**BiLSTMCharE2E**.)

**[CRF for Punctuation Restoration](https://github.com/anthonyhughes/crf-punctuation-restoration)**<br>
Conditional Random Fields model for a punctuation restoration task. (Referred to in the paper as **CRF**.)

**[Punctuation Restoration using Transformer
Models](https://github.com/anthonyhughes/finetuning-en-punctuation-restoration)**<br>
An extension of the paper Punctuation Restoration using Transformer Models for High-and Low-Resource Languages accepted
at the EMNLP workshop W-NUT 2020. (Referred to in the paper as **BERTBiLSTM**.) -->
